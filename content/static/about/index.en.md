Who am I? And why did i create a blog?.And why should you read what I write here? And what is Nobelium ApS?

Let's take one at a time.
- My name is Steffen, and I live in Grenå on Djursland (In Denmark). Together with my wife and daughter.
- I've made this blog to have a place to write down my thoughts. I'm very reserved towards modern social media, but very open to technology. To have my own blog / own website allows me to own my own data. And to handle it on my own terms. Admitted Google and Facebook can index my site and get my information anyway. This is okay by me!
- Why should you read my blog? It's simple to answer. Dont read blogs to learn, then you should write blog posts. Quite simplified, and most likely wrong. I follow a few blogs myself, and I learn from them too. What I'm trying to say is that when you write something down about a topic. You get deeper into the material. So it's a good tool for self study.
- So what is Nobelium ApS? It's a holding company I own, which owns part of another company. I like the name, so I use this as the basis of my personal website.

What will I write about?
- Small topics I find it interesting to dive into.
- Notes that will help me remember small things.

But which topics? Time will tell, but I expect it to be primarily web technologies.

Men hvilke emner? Tiden må vise dette, men jeg forventer at det primært bliver web teknologier

Without going too deep I will explain how, and what to do.
For these examples I will be using Pixelmator Pro, but everything say will hold equally true in Photoshop, Gimp or any other image editing software.
First a short description of what color spaces are. A color space defines which colors are available. Some color spaces are very large, and others are more limited.</description></item><item><title>Excel Vlookup</title><link>https://www.nobelium-aps.dk/en/blog/excel-vlookup/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Mar 2021 10:50:43 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.nobelium-aps.dk/en/blog/excel-vlookup/</guid><description>Excel vlookup is super usefull, but I can never remember how to use it. So it&amp;rsquo;s always a struggle, and wastes a lot of time.

Such as monitors, phones, printers, scanners and inside software. It&amp;rsquo;s actually not so complicated to understand what it is in general. But it can be a little opaque sometimes especially when you talk printing, and image files. Then it&amp;rsquo;s easy to get a little confused. Actually DPI should be used when talking about prints, and PPI (Pixels Per Inch) should be used for displays.</description></item></channel></rss>
